			<font size = "4">
			<p>Wrote a program in which the computer guesses a variable length word that the user picks among a list of over 60,000 samples.<br>
			Guessed by calculating the next most likely letter based on current result of guessing, learning from the input word pool.</p>

		<font size = "5"><li> Sea Surface Wind & Current Monitoring System </li> </font>
		<font size = "4">
			<p>	Collected real-time data from the wind speed and sea current central sensor node via either Bluetooth LE or 3.0 and transmitted data to the remote server with UDP for further MATLAB processing.<br>
			Parsed and visualized wind and current data on line graphs in the app along with real time animation to vividly show users the wind speed and sea current.<br>
			Designed the system communication protocol and data format after communicating with fellow hardware and software developers, considering robustness and compatibility.<br>

		<font size = "5"><li> Sailing Game Training Device Monitoring System </li> </font>
		<font size = "4">
			<p>	Programmed the Bluetooth LE module based on Texas Instrument CC2541 to receive data from tension and distance sensors, which measured the movement and force applied when sailing athletes use the training device.<br>Parsed the data according to self-defined format, displayed the tension and force data on a LCD screen, and sent the data to an Android device for energy calculation.<br>
